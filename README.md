# Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Task 1: Business Sales Dashboard

## Objective
The primary goal was to analyze e-commerce data to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, and high-revenue categories to support business decision-making.

## Key Techniques & Deliverables
* **Data Cleaning (Power Query):** Handled complex date format inconsistencies (MM/DD/YYYY vs. MM-DD-YYYY), ensured all numeric columns were correctly typed (Decimal/Whole Number), and removed corrupted data rows.
* **DAX Measures:** Created core financial KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Ratio (essential for profitability comparison), and Total Quantity.
* **Visualization:** Developed a comprehensive dashboard featuring time-series analysis (Line Chart), categorical performance (Bar Chart), and product ranking (Table sorted by Quantity).

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
* **Trend:** Sales showed a strong upward trajectory year-over-year from 2014 to 2017.
* **Revenue:** The **Technology** category is the primary driver of revenue.
* **Profitability:** The **Home Office** segment yields the highest profit ratio, indicating higher efficiency in that customer group.
